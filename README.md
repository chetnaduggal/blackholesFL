 
The technique involves fitting the radio luminosity (LR), X-ray luminosity (LX), and blackhole mass (M) of the sample sources to the Fundamental Plane (FP) modelâ€” an empirical relationship in the three-dimensional (log LR, log LX, logM) space that blackhole systems with jets are found to exhibit. The maximum-likelihood and uncertainty estimations of the FP model parameters are calculated using a Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) algorithm (using [emcee](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package). 
I perform this analysis on a sample created by cross-matching 729 SDSS quasars (0< z <4) with known LX and LR with SDSS/DR14-based quasar catalog of single-epoch virial blackhole masses.
